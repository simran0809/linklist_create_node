# linklist_create_node
A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a series of nodes connected by pointers (in C or C++) or references (in Java, Python and JavaScript). Each node contains data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the list
